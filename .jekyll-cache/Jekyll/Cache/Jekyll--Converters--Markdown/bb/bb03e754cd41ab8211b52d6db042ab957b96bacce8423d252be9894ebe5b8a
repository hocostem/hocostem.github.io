I"<p><strong>Why did you choose to pursue this career? What made you certain this was the right path?</strong></p>

<p>I always enjoyed the biological sciences. I think it had to do with my 5th grade science teacher. She made me fall in love with science. That is why I ended up doing a Ph.D. in Microbiology.</p>

<p><strong>What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?</strong></p>

<p>I went to Science Honors school for an undergraduate degree in Microbiology. I later did a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Medical Biotechnology.</p>

<p><strong>How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?</strong></p>

<p>I did hands on research early on during undergraduate years which helped me to pursue a Ph.D. Once in Science as a career, I think looking for the right mentors and working with them helped me grow.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?</strong></p>

<p>I would advise to start early, tinker with science and if it interests you, go for it. Take the time to find the right mentors for you. That time is never wasted. Your educational experience and the right mentors are the ticket to a fruitful career.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?</strong></p>

<p>I think laboratory experience early on is the key for scientific careers. We live in a county where there are a lot of such opportunities with APL and ARL being so close. Look for such opportunities to work in the labs when you can.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)?</strong></p>

<p>I did my undergraduate in a well funded university. I took the opportunity to intern in laboratories when I could. Doing this I not only got the exposure and experience I needed, but also got paid for it.</p>

<p><strong>What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?</strong></p>

<p>Instead of rushing into a degree or a post-doctoral degree, I wish I had actually taken the time to find the right mentor and laboratory before starting work in a scientists laboratory.</p>

<p><strong>What does a typical day at your job look like? What sort of projects do you work on?</strong></p>

<p>I work in the field of technology transfer. This deals with taking technologies from the laboratory as a real product into the market. I also advise on patenting of technologies the scientists develop in the laboratories. We at WRAIR work on infectious diseases and Neuroscience.</p>

<p><strong>What was a surprising aspect of your job?</strong></p>

<p>To understand that a lot of technologies being worked on in the laboratories for years dont actually make it into the market. To understand basic science is important just for our knowledge and growth of science in general.</p>

<p><strong>What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?</strong></p>

<p>I think as scientists we get into a narrow field and stick to it for years. Sometimes we forget to think outside the box can be helpful in all fields. I think therefore collaborating with others on different aspects of science is very important for growth.</p>

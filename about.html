	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>The Howard County STEM website was made as a part of a Girl Scout Gold Award aimed at giving students guidance and confidence in pursuing STEM disciplines.</p>  
	
	<h2>â€‹What is STEM?</h2>
	<p>STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math.</p>

	<h2>Why is this project important?</h2>
	<p>Many students lack confidence when they have no guidance.  STEM minorities, such as low income families, women, and ethnic minorities, are often underrepresented due to a knowledge gap.  This website is a tool for students to research about a variety of STEM disciplines.  The information offered on HocoStem is aimed to promote an awareness of a wide variety of STEM fields.</p>

        <h1><strong>Ms. Borden, Meteorologist for National Weather Service</strong></h1>
        <h4>Published 08 Jun 2020</h4>
        <p><strong>Why did you choose to pursue this career/major?  What made you certain this was the right path?</strong></p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a meteorologist since I was 7 years old.  Knowing one wants to be a meteorologist from an early age seems to be a recurring theme across the National Weather Service.  I broke my leg snow skiing when I was 7.  As my bones were healing, I could feel the weather change.  My mother suggested I become a meteorologist when I grow up.  Once I looked it up in the dictionary, I knew that it was what I wanted to do.  Up until that point my only exposure to “weather” were the people on TV.  At that time most of those people (especially in the area I grew up) were not degreed meteorologist and were broadcasters.  Once I found out meteorology was a science I wanted to learn as much as I could and decided it was what I was going to do when I went to college.  In most ways this was good because the math and science required for a meteorology degree is massive and I was not the strongest math or science student in grade school through high school.  At the time I did not realize teachers were trying to steer me away from that field, especially being a girl.  My passion was too strong, and I was able to reach my dream.</p>

<p><strong>What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you where you are today?</strong></p>

<p>I was a student trainee at the National Weather Service office in Alaska while I was in college.</p>

<p><strong>What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you earn to prepare for this career?</strong></p>

<p>BS Degree in meteorology
MS Degree in Education
Lots of communication courses
Lots of Emergency Management/FEMA courses</p>

<p><strong>How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?</strong></p>

<p>I worked hard and tried to get every opportunity to experience my chosen field.  I looked for volunteer positions, and paid/non-paid internships.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?</strong></p>

<p>Learn as much about the field as you can.  If you are passionate pursue it.  Also pair a meteorology degree with something else you might be interested in such as math, computers, education, Emergency Management.  If you really love what you do, going to work 20+ years later is still exciting.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?</strong></p>

<p>Visit your local NWS office or another opportunity to watch someone in action.  Form a mentorship with that person.  Join a professional organization in your desired field.  Very often there are student rates.  Surround yourself when you can with people that share similar interests.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)?</strong></p>

<p>While in high school there wasn’t much help I could get.  While in college I worked for a program in my field.  I attended professional conference where I presented research I worked on.  I tried to create a large personal network.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?</strong></p>

<p>Not at the time.  I am glad I decided to get a master’s degree in education even though it was not exactly advised positively to me.  It has helped me get to where I am today.</p>

<p><strong>What does a typical day at your job look like?  What sort of projects do you work on?</strong></p>

<p>The best thing about being a forecaster at the National Weather Service is each day is usually different!  Weather is never the same from day to day, so it is not boring.  Also, I get to work in the community with partners and provide them with lifesaving information.</p>

<p><strong>What was a surprising aspect of your job?</strong></p>

<p>How much I enjoy mentoring new employees.</p>

<p><strong>What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?</strong></p>

<p>Being an excellent communicator.  Understanding all the English and history classes you are forced to take are important.  I write every day, sometimes for a major portion of my day.  I must be able to communicate and figure out multiple ways to get a message across.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any advice you would like to share?  If so, please include here.</strong></p>

<p>Be passionate.  Follow that passion and be willing to pair multiple passions together, even if they do not seem like they naturally fit together.</p>

        <p><strong>Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?</strong></p>

<p>In my childhood, going outdoors was a passion of mine. I loved to go outdoors and just look at whatever thing was crawling around in my backyard. Most of the time, it happened to be a bug. As such, I decided to pursue such a passion in my career.</p>

<p><strong>What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?</strong></p>

<p>Working with other members of the USDA while being an army entomologist lead to me working here later on.</p>

<p><strong>What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?</strong></p>

<p>I completed a PhD for this career.</p>

<p><strong>How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?</strong></p>

<p>In my education, I studied hard. Also, I worked through the military.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?</strong></p>

<p>This is a fairly broad field of work, so my advice would be to look at the variations within this field. Additionally, be prepared to hold positions that will give you field experience.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?</strong></p>

<p>For this field of work, definitely outdoors activities. Activities such as scouting, various outdoor based clubs, and just general hobbies such as hiking and biking.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)</strong></p>

<p>I took on jobs at nature day camps during my summers.</p>

<p><strong>What does a typical day at your job look like?</strong></p>

<p>Looking at what pests get into American agriculture and finding out origins, preferred crop and how we reduce its prevalence.</p>

<p><strong>What was a surprising aspect of your job?</strong></p>

<p>I was surprised at how much I loved doing it.</p>

<p><strong>What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?</strong></p>

<p>As the job largely involves bugs which is a fear of many people, you must be okay with seeing and touching bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any additional advice?</strong></p>

<p>Be open to opportunities, be willing to take jobs that will give you a lot of experience with maybe not too much pay and be enthusiastic about what you do.</p>

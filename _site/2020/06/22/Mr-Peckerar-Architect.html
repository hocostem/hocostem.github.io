        <h1><strong>Mr. Peckerar, Senior Associate at Beatty Harvey & Associates Architects</strong></h1>
        <h4>Published 22 Jun 2020</h4>
        <p><strong>Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?</strong></p>

<p>I took a drafting course in high school and I was hooked.</p>

<p><strong>What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?</strong></p>

<p>While at school I worked during the Summer at the office of Max O. Urbahn. The project we were working on was Nassau County Community Hospital. This led to me using this knowledge for my Architectural thesis, Lincoln Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?</strong></p>

<p>City College of NY. Part of the City University of NY required a five year course leading to a Bachelor of Science after the fourth year and a Bachelor of Architecture after the fifth year. Three years of experience under the auspices of a registered Architect were required to take the Architectural license exam. This exam consisted of seven parts over four days and an individual had three years to pass all four parts. The exam was administered every six months, so you had six tries to pass seven parts. The design portion of the exam was a 12-hour ordeal while the other parts varied between three and four hours each. A passing grade was 70 and I passed six parts the first time and the seventh part the next time. I was licensed in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. Later in my career I became licensed in California.</p>

<p><strong>How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?</strong></p>

<p>After working at Max Urbahn’s office, I joined a small startup firm of Albert Schunkewitz and Partners where I was able to plan many Hospital projects under the watchful eye of the principal partner, Mr, Schunkewitz.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?</strong></p>

<p>College was hard work and long hours - be prepared for this “ordeal”. Choose a college with a School of Architecture that is approved by the American Institute of Architects and work hard.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?</strong></p>

<p>Try to get a summer job in the industry or in construction.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)</strong></p>

<p>Summer jobs in Max O. Urbahn’s office.</p>

<p><strong>What does a typical day at your job look like?</strong></p>

<p>You do not punch a clock. The job is not a 9-5 situation. There is usually a deadline to be met and you work as many hours as it takes to meet that deadline.</p>

<p><strong>What was a surprising aspect of your job?</strong></p>

<p>From the time I was first licensed in 1970 until the time I retired in 2007, women became a predominant part of the Architectural work force.</p>

<p><strong>What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?</strong></p>

<p>Knowledge of design and construction for obvious reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any additional advice?</strong></p>

<p>Be prepared for hard work but there is no greater feeling than to see something you put on paper, from your thoughts, become a reality as a building.</p>

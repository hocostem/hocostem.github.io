        <h1><strong>Ms. Devine, Molecular Biology Lab Technician for UMBC Department of Biological Sciences</strong></h1>
        <h4>Published 27 Apr 2020</h4>
        <p><strong>Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?</strong></p>

<p>I had a keen interest in biology and medicine throughout my undergraduate career, and I found I was most comfortable in a laboratory environment. I knew that molecular biology technicians can help answer many different research questions so I knew that pursuing this career in molecular biology would provide me with success in the biology research field.</p>

<p><strong>What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?</strong></p>

<p>The Phage Hunters genetics lab course offered at UMBC first gave me a taste of scientific research. I also interned at the Medical Examiner’s office in the toxicology laboratory which provided me with a better understanding of how a laboratory is run. Finally, my master’s program helped me network with professors at UMBC, where I was hired on as a lab tech in the Vonhoff lab.</p>

<p><strong>What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?</strong></p>

<p>I received a B.A. degree in Biological Sciences as well as a M.S. degree in Applied Molecular Biology. I also had to gain experience by working in a laboratory setting, which I did while completing my degrees.</p>

<p><strong>How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?</strong></p>

<p>I made sure that I completed all prerequisites for the AMB master’s program during Summer and Winter classes as to limit my time at school. I worked throughout college so I also had to utilize my free time to finish assignments. What really helped me was making a weekly plan for my assignments for school but also for work projects. That is something I still do to this day, especially since some weeks can be busier than others.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?</strong></p>

<p>Talk to your professors! They most likely run their own labs at the school and may have openings. You should try to get into a lab as soon as you can. That is the one thing I didn’t do which would have helped my experiences in a lab setting.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?</strong></p>

<p>You should try for a university lab or even an internship in a lab outside of school.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)</strong></p>

<p>Internships and research labs during my master’s program.</p>

<p><strong>What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?</strong></p>

<p>I really wish I had known about being able to work at the labs on campus, which I didn’t find out about until I was ready to graduate.</p>

<p><strong>What does a typical day at your job look like?</strong></p>

<p>I could be doing anything from simply placing supply orders to actually performing experiments. I currently am working on a CRISPR related project where I create plasmid constructs to inject into fly embryos in order to make a transgenic fly line.</p>

<p><strong>What was a surprising aspect of your job?</strong></p>

<p>The high level of collaboration between the many labs here. We are always helping each other troubleshoot or find better strategies for our projects.</p>

<p><strong>What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?</strong></p>

<p>You definitely need to be attentive to details, even the smallest ones. Also try to be consistent in your work, and write everything down!</p>

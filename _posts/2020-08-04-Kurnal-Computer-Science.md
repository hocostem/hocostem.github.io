**Why did you choose to pursue this major?**

When I was in high school, I attended a hackathon called SpaceApps on a whim with a bunch of friends. While there I was inspired to create and enjoyed the hacker environment the community supported. I began to participate in more hackathons and made a lot of friends and ideas along the way. They inspired me to create, and theyâ€™re the reason I chose to pursue a startup today.

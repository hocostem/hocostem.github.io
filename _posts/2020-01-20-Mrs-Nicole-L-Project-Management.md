**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I chose my college major, Chemical Engineering, because I enjoyed math and chemistry and wanted a job where I knew I could always support myself financially.  I eventually moved into project management and less technical jobs, but the problem solving I learned in my undergraduate education continues to serve me well.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

Bachelor’s Degree in Chemical Engineering, master’s degree in strategic Intelligence and Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

Always be willing to try something new.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Don't give up.  Getting your degree is likely to be one of the hardest things you've ever done.  Stick with it.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Anything that interests them.  Stretch yourself, one opportunity seems to lead to others so put yourself out there.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

My undergraduate program was a 5-year co-op program where I graduated with a year of internships (fall, spring and summer internships).  This allowed me the chance to try different things and enter the workforce out of college with a better idea of what work I enjoyed the most.

**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

Well...In some sense I followed the path of least resistance. I enjoyed my Computer Science classes and was given (extraordinary, really) opportunities to purse the field.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

My dad (through his work) would bring computers home, and so from a young age, I got to play around with and programming them. I took Computer Science classes in high-school and landed a chance research assistant position my Sophomore year in college. The position was funded by my current workplace. When I finished school, I was immediately offered a job and that was that.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

CS classes in HS. A BS, MS, and PhD in CS. No certifications.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

Becoming involved in the CS community (really, my subspecialty of CS).

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

I'm not convinced the world needs even more Computer Scientists, and I worry about students being exploited --- my brother-in-law graduated from college with a BS in CS and hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt. Certainly the career can be worthwhile, but the market seems flooded for what is essentially a degree in complicated mathematics, maybe due to people incorrectly equating their joy using a computer with the study of the science behind computation.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

There are often computer clubs and programming contests in HS.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I was able to do an independent study in CS during HS.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I believe that a typical day is similar to any office job. I work with groups of people to build tools and techniques that improve the security of computers.

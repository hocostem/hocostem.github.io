**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I wanted to be a doctor, but my dad felt I would be good at engineering. I started college and honestly did not like my classes. Then, after my sophomore year, I worked as a student engineer and loved it. So, I finished my degree and stayed in engineering.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

I worked at my agency during college. I graduated and worked there full time. I’ve stayed at the same agency my whole career but worked in several different offices. So, I’ve had a variety of experiences despite staying with one employer.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I have a Bachelors of Science and a Master’s of Science in Electrical Engineering.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

This is a broad question. I’d say that by continuing to learn new technologies and not be afraid to try and fail, I’ve made the best use of my education and career.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

We are so fortunate to have the Maker movement online. There are so many electronics kits and YouTube videos. You can try out microcontroller programming and learn basic circuit theory before going to college. Study math. Take Physics and Chemistry and don’t stress if you take them again in college. It gives you a chance to really learn it. The theoretical courses aren’t always what the job is like, but understand the basic principles and you will do well.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

I would do clubs that you enjoy. Life isn’t all about work. So, yes, you could join the robotics club and you would learn things that are useful for electronics. But it isn’t necessary for later success in your career. If you want to do a club outside of STEM, go for it.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I took a co-operative education position during college and I learned so much that I did not learn in school.

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

I just wish the Internet had come along sooner for me. It’s great for any question I have.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I have a variety of tasks. I program microcontrollers using C code. I’ve done some web design. I am now also in charge of projects and so I have to understand timelines and project management. Many students are worried about being stuck at a desk all day. I’d say I’m at a lab bench a bit; in meetings ironing out project details or meeting vendors; collaborating with my peers. I don’t feel stuck all by myself.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

I’ve been surprised at the variety of projects I’ve worked on.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

You have to be able to concentrate and think logically. You have to be able to work alone...you can ask coworkers for advice or help troubleshoot, but you also need to spend time on your own drawing schematics and writing software.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

Don’t give up on a STEM career until you’ve had a chance to do an internship in the field. I did not enjoy college even though I did very well in college. But I love my job. I found college to be very different from my job and my college job is the reason I stayed in the degree.

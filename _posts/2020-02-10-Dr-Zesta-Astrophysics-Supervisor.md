**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I always liked physics and stars; never knew I would end up on this specific path but followed the steps. The most important thing to me in life is knowledge and understanding, nothing else really mattered to me.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

All of my studies, from undergrad to post-doctorate, led me to research positions at UCLA, DOD, and then NASA. NASA appealed to me most as I could do space instrumentation rather than ground instrumentation as I had previously been doing.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I got my bachelors, and masters in astrophysics research, and got my PhD in astronomy and space physics.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

I studied very hard, worked A LOT, and slowly learned how to manage my time. I went to conferences and took on projects that allowed me to get noticed in my career. The most exhausting part of my career and education was learning that there are no menial tasks, and everything required such intense, specific focus in my field.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Research! The research that I do is a lot of fun, and feels almost insane to get paid for it, but it requires a lot of dedication as well. The best way to pursue this career is to consistently pursue every single task, no matter how small, as if it is a huge project. You must also learn to be independent and creative, as no one will tell you what to do and you have to constantly question everything. This is the essence of research.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Internships- as many as absolutely possible. Talk to parents of friends, go to their place of work and meet new people. Learn how to go from a book of equations to realistic applications.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

In my masters and PhD, I participated in conferences and competitions where I was constantly researching and presenting my work.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I do daily telecons with companies that my team is working with, meet with colleagues in the planetary sciences- most recently we discussed what instrument packages we will create for the new lunar landers. I talk with engineers and other scientists about instruments for my satellite mission, and other ideas related to it. I talk a lot with the scientists in my lab, organize research, etc.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

The politics associated with my job. People are people, and politics reign everywhere, especially being close to D.C.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

Independence, creativity, working above average, being naturally intelligent, ambitious, persuasive persistence, comfort with being questioned, and elements of service and duty to our country and organization.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

People can do anything they want to do, but the most valuable skills when pursuing your goals and dreams is being able to break down large tasks into smaller tasks and being able to build relationships with others.

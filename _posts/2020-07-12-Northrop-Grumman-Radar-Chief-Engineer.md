**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I enjoyed and excelled in math and science in high school.  My older cousin was an engineer and i enjoyed fixing things.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

I stated with Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Defense and Electronics Center) in Baltimore after finishing college in 1985.  In 1996 Northrop Grumman Corporation purchased this division of Westinghouse.  I have worked my whole career in the same business and location.  Since Westinghouse/Northrop Grumman employs tens of thousands of people in this business area I choose to stay with them my entire career and plan to retire from Northrop Grumman in the near future.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 1985 and my MS in Electrical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1991.  At the time, Westinghouse offered full tuition reimbursement while pursuing an advanced degree in evenings, part time.  It took me 4 years to earn my MSEE degree.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

During my time at the University of Pittsburgh I focused primarily on my education and classwork.  There were not as many opportunities as there are today for college students.  Work for the most part is satisfying most of the time.  Fortunately, in my roles at work I did not have to put too much extra time in at office and had a good work life balance.  I made sure to be a good father and support my wife and family to the fullest extent possible.  That was more fulfilling to me than climbing the corporate ladder.  I was able to complete my MSEE degree and graduate one month before I got married.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Having a STEM degree, in my opinion, is a great degree to have.  It takes hard work to complete the degree while getting good grades and all potential employers know that.  Having a technical degree can open up opportunities in other types of employment as well.   

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

My advice to all high school students is to be involved in any type of extracurricular activities that you may excel in and always try activities outside your comfort zone.  This is the time in your life to try new things and stretch yourself.   

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I grew up in a large family of 10 people with one income.  My father worked as a laborer in a small factory and my mother was a full-time mom.  I learned from them to have a good work ethic and care for each other.  At an early age I focused on working and saving money for college.  I did not take advantage of any research or internships.  In my day, the opportunities were quite different from what is available today.

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

I wish I was encouraged by others to get involved in other activities at the university outside of classwork.  I did join the Marching Band my senior year and had a blast.  

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I am the lead electrical engineering on a production program following many electrical issues that come up.  We use many outside side suppliers that often have electrical issue to address and resolve.  I am also involved with process improvements to reduce the cycle time for manufacturing and testing our RADAR products.  I also work with older RADARs in the field and support those international customers with field return repairs.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

As an engineer I tend to think a certain way while working on technological issues.  When those ideas result in delivering hardware and systems to outside customers there are many other people involved.  Those other people typically have many other challenges to address and overcome.  Understanding their approaches to getting their job done needs to be understood and it may not be typically intuitive.  Every job has specific procedures that must be followed and understood to help everyone involved work as one team in getting the total job completed and the product delivered.   

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

I personally think paying attention to detail is the most crucial aspect of any job.  It tends to be the small details when inadvertently overlooked that can result in major delays and severe cost impact to the company.  There is always a fine balance in everything.  One does not have unlimited resources when addressing any problem.  Being flexible and open minded is a must.  I try my hardest to supply all the known information to those above me who have to make the tough decisions.  At times I don't always agree with their decision but always accept them at the time.  If other information is uncovered later, decisions can be adjusted.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

Always look out for yourself.  Learn to be confident at all times and don't be afraid to ask for help and guidance.  Don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake.  Gaining the skill sets needed promote oneself is crucial.  Don't expect your manager to always have your best interest in mind and to promote your abilities.

**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

In my childhood, going outdoors was a passion of mine. I loved to go outdoors and just look at whatever thing was crawling around in my backyard. Most of the time, it happened to be a bug. As such, I decided to pursue such a passion in my career.

Working with other members of the USDA while being an army entomologist lead to me working here later on.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I completed a PhD for this career.

In my education, I studied hard. Also, I worked through the military.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

This is a fairly broad field of work, so my advice would be to look at the variations within this field. Additionally, be prepared to hold positions that will give you field experience.

For this field of work, definitely outdoors activities. Activities such as scouting, various outdoor based clubs, and just general hobbies such as hiking and biking.

I took on jobs at nature day camps during my summers.

As the job largely involves bugs which is a fear of many people, you must be okay with seeing and touching bugs.

**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I always liked numbers and seeing how things around us can often be numerically modeled.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

I had several math teachers in middle/high school who were big influences.  They helped me (1) be more organized in my problem solving, and (2) motivated me to look at how math can be applied beyond the classroom.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I obtained a double B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and then a M.S. in Applied Mathematics

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

Staying organized has been a huge benefit.  Being able to picture what direction I want to proceed to get to a solution - whether setting up an answer to an advanced math problem, or addressing a complex project at work - and then remaining focused on maintaining that direction despite distractions or complications has been an important tool for me.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Seek others who are in this area of study and ask lots of questions.  There is a wide range of jobs in the Mathematics and/or Statistics field and it is valuable to understand what real life opportunities await you should you choose to pursue this area of study.  Also, it is important to gain some computer science knowledge, such as learning a programming language.  Most Mathematics/Statistics applications leverage computing resources.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

In my case, the best opportunities were the ones I created - While in high school, I chose two of my favorite hobbies and started statistical-focused projects that helped me learn more about my hobby, as well as re-enforce my passion for math.  That happened before the internet and proliferation of computing, so today's opportunities are limitless.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

In addition to the aforementioned pursuit of projects related to your hobbies/passion, it is critical to pursue internships related to your field of study.  I participated in a cooperative education program while in college, and it led to a permanent job with my current employer.   Not only will internships provide you with job experience to serve as an advantage when seeking a job after college, but it will help you determine what specific role(s) you want to pursue (or avoid!) in your career.

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

In my case, not really.  But a common answer I hear for this question is "I wish I had been more open-minded to opportunities that I hadn't considered".

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

Earlier in my career, I worked projects which required examining large amounts of data, looking for characteristics that would be statistically significant.  This required learning about various statistical tests, writing software to apply these tests, and doing research to learn about the work of others.  I now lead an organization of technical people (engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists) and daily I get the opportunity to learn about new technologies that are used in the communications industry.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

I was surprised (and still am) to see how important Mathematics/Statistics is to leadership when making decisions about nearly everything in the business and technology industries.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

Persistence, focus, and the flexibility to re-examine problems when incorrect initial assumptions are made.

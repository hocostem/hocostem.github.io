**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I had a love for science and research from a young age. Learning about biomechanics and the intricate systems of the body fascinated me, and physical therapy allows me to apply this knowledge to help people prevent injuries and continue doing the activities that they love.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

During college, I worked as a physical therapy tech which gave me a glimpse at what I'd be doing as a physical therapist on a daily basis. I also sought out any opportunity I could to connect with people in the field. Although it can be awkward to ask strangers to talk to you about their job, it gave me a lot of valuable information. I even still keep in touch with some of them now!

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

To apply to PT school, you have to have a bachelorâ€™s degree (in any field). After I finished college, I chose to work in research for 2 years before heading back to PT school. PT school is 2.5-3.5 years and then you're required to take a boards certification exam before being able to be hired and practice as a PT.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

Look into PTs in your area, ask if you can talk to them or even shadow them for a day. Outpatient clinics, sports settings, and hospitals are just a few settings that PTs can work in.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**


Any opportunity that piques your interest! High school is a great time to try out a bunch of different things to really learn what you're passionate about.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I worked in research labs that explored genetic muscular disorders, balance systems, and biomechanics. I also shadowed in a ton of different PT settings.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

Most days, I am treating patients. I spend 45 minutes with each patient to advance their program, assess how they're moving, and treat any injuries.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

The ability to think critically and identify factors that may be causing patients' pain is a necessary skill. PTs must also be empathetic and good at listening to patients to hear their stories.

**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I chose to become a pediatrician because I love kids and I love medicine. I also had a younger sister who was disabled and we had to go to a lot of doctors when I was younger. This made me very interested in the medical field and helping people. I always had a very strong interest in science and I especially loved Biology 2 and dissecting things.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

I had a younger sister with disabilities, which ignited my great interest in the medical field by exposing me to the exceptional difference doctors can make in people’s lives. I was working in the hospital long hours and overnight shifts. When I had kids, I decided I wanted to have a job with normal business hours, so I shifted to a pediatric office.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I went to college, medical school, and did a pediatric residency, all at the University of Maryland. I am board certified in pediatrics by the American Board of pediatrics. I am also licensed by the state of Maryland to practice medicine.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

I made the best use of my time because I was an extremely focused studier. I would set aside a very focused time to get my studying and work done so I could have time later to relax.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Advice that I would give to high school or college students is that you have to make sure you really want to pursue a career in this field because it is a very long and strenuous process. If you are not really committed to it, you will not be successful and it will be a waste.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

I would highly suggest that high school students volunteer at a hospital or doctors or shadow someone in the medical field. Getting this hands on experience will be extremely beneficial for your future.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

While I was in college, I worked a summer job doing research at a biotechnology company. I also volunteered at a health clinic while I was in college which provided free medical care to needy patients.

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

In regards to my career and education, I wish that I took a year off in between college and medical school. I think that it would’ve been good to do some things for myself before I dedicated myself to my career and education.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I see patients and go to appointments for three hours in the morning. I then have a one-hour lunch break where I also do a lot of my charting and answering phone calls. Then, I do another three hours of seeing patients in the afternoon. After that is more charting and phone calls. Throughout the day, I also have to check the labs I ordered for certain patients. I also review specialist notes or Emergency Room visits of my patients. 

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

A surprise aspect of my job is that insurance companies suck and that doctors don’t make a lot of money. Another surprising aspect was the amount of paperwork and charting there is to do; it is a lot.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

Qualities that are necessary to be successful in the medical or pediatric field are that you have to be good and quick at making decisions, empathetic, good with talking to kids, and good at staying calm in difficult situations.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

Advice I would like to share is that sleep when you can. Also, medical school is really expensive, so try not to get a lot of debt in undergraduate school. Also, choose your career path based on what really interests you, not by how much money you will make.

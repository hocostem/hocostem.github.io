**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

My high school math teacher really opened my eyes to how great the mathematical field is and introduced the concept of cryptology to me.  Once I understood what that meant and what it entailed, I was hooked.  I purposely choose a college that would give me a strong math background and help me get into the cryptologic field, which I have worked in for nearly 20 years now.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

I attended the Naval Academy and earned a math degree and was able to become a cryptologic officer for the Navy.  The Navy is the only service that has a dedicated cryptologic community which is why I joined the Navy because of my interest in cryptology.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

I have a BS in Math which is foundational to cryptology.  During my time in this community, I became very interested in developing and building our cryptographic systems and earned a MS in Project Management to help build skills that would allow me to develop and manage the development of cryptologic systems.  I have also become a government certified program manager that allows me to lead acquisition programs.

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

I earned my Master's through distance learning so I could continue to work in the field while pursuing higher education rather than pausing my career for two years while I went to school.  This gave me an edge over my peers since I gained additional experience while gaining the same levels of education as my peers.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

The cryptologic field, along with all STEM fields, are very technical which requires a lot of dedication to your studies to gain a firm grasp of the material.  These are subjects that you need to study every day, not just a few times a week.  Take the time to focus on your STEM coursework every day.  It will pay huge dividends in the long-term.  Once you finish your formalized schooling, don't stop learning.  Always push yourself to learn about the newest technology in your chosen field.  Technology evolves quickly, if you don't pay attention, you will find yourself behind in understanding where your field is going.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Internships are huge opportunities for you.  Look for companies in your field that have internship opportunities.  If there is a company in your area that you like, set up a meeting to see if you would be able to shadow their executives, participate in internships, etc.  Face-to-face meetings go a long way towards getting you opportunities.  Don't rely on text or email; meet people in person.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I didn't do anything and I now regret it and realize what a big opportunity I lost.  It is up to you to drive your career and opportunities.  

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

I wish I had looked for internships.  I lost a great opportunity to learn from people in my field that were shaping where my field was going.  Look for mentors and use them to gain skills to help you in the future.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I am on an operations floor that operates 24/7 and I stand watch 3-4 days a week for 12-hour shifts.  During that time, I help respond to world events to keep Americans safe who are operating in extremely dangerous environments.  

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

Some of the technical solutions we as a government have developed to overcome challenges we face are mind boggling.  There are extremely smart and dedicated Americans who work tirelessly to keep this country safe, and they do an exceptional job.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

You have to be willing to work hard, keep a positive attitude, and constantly challenge yourself.  If you feel comfortable, you aren't growing.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

We are in a very digital age and it is easy to default to texting and email, but meeting someone in person goes a long way.  It is very easy to tell someone no over email or text because it is impersonal.  People have a harder time saying no to someone in person, use that to your advantage.  Meet with people in person.  

Be proactive; don't let things happen to you, you need to shape your environment.  You won't get what you want, just because you want it, you have to be proactive and take steps that will get you what you want.  That may mean doing something now you don't enjoy in order to get gains several years in the future.  Think in the long-term (months to years), not the short-term (days to weeks).

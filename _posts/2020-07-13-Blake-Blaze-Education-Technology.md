**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

It's a long story, but I really lucked out that I majored in math in college.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

My high school teachers had a huge influence on me and my decision to major in math. My love of team sports sparked my interest in the Navy, and now as I transition out, I get to go back to my interest in STEM and education.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

Undergraduate degree in mathematics

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

By recognizing that there are always opportunities to learn, even if there aren't formal certificates or degrees available.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

1) Recognize that there is someone out there who wants the same goal you want and that you have to outwork that person every single day in order to earn it. 2) Be confident in pursuing what you love because even if you don't end up exactly where you'd like to be, you'll be prepared to do something similar.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Travel to different parts of the country or of your state in order to be somewhere new and outside of your comfort zone.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I traveled and pursued internships in college. High school internships don't matter for your resume but do help you figure out what you want to do. I shadowed an ER doctor and realized I didn't want to be an ER doctor.

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

I wish I'd stayed closer with my college professors.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I always learned something new at work. In my current role at a startup it varies day to day, but mostly I have to be creative and pragmatic in approaching problems we face. I have to use a lot of empathy and creativity in order to communicate concepts to people, which is the real value of a STEM education and power of working in a STEM field.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

How much bureaucracy there is in the Navy. Overall loved working in military intelligence.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

Patience and perseverance. It's never enough to do what is easy, and this includes what is easy to envision.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

Anything worth doing is worth overdoing.

**Why did you choose to pursue this major?**

I like chemistry and knowing what things are made of.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you where you are today? Are you in any specific college programs that you would recommend?**

Engineers without Borders is great for college students whether or not they want to go abroad. I first knew I liked chemistry when I became fascinated with the periodic table.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Do whatever you like to in high school. STEM related activities might look good on your resume, but do what you enjoy first (if that’s a STEM club that’s great too!). Doing what you like will help you know what you really want to do and will keep your spirits up.

**What opportunities have you taken to advance your career (research, internships, etc.)? What have you learned through these experiences?**

I’ve interned at Johns Hopkins, APL, and Engineers without Borders. Internships have helped me consider what I really want to do and in what environment. They also helped me understand that it really does take applying everywhere over and over again to find an opportunity. Most of all, they helped me understand how important thinking through your ethical standpoint on anything STEM related is. Research is powerful, and knowing who you are helping and how is very important. I helped with a couple animal-testing related projects in the past that I now disagree with and can plan for this in the future. Apply for a lot, but know who you are affecting.

**Do you have any advice you would like to share?**

Ask as many questions as you want! If you feel uncomfortable asking in-person, the internet is a great resource.

**Why did you choose to pursue this major?**

It’s my passion.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you where you are today? Are you in any specific college programs that you would recommend?**

Science Fairs.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Science Fair, Robotics, Coding Clubs.

**What opportunities have you taken to advance your career (research, internships, etc.)? What have you learned through these experiences?**

Internships, personal projects, research out of curiosity.

**Do you have any advice you would like to share?**

Only do CS if you’re passionate about it, not for the money. If you don’t have a passion for it you won’t like what you end up doing for a living. It’s one of those things that requires that drive and passion in order to actually enjoy what you’re doing for a living despite the money.

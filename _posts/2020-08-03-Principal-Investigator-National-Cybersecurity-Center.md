**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

It is a challenging field with a lot of employment opportunities

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

Recruiters came to my university which introduced me to Government employment opportunities. Once hired, I joined an internal 3-year internship program which allowed me to work in different divisions before selecting a long-term position.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

BSEE, CISSP, PMP

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

I tried to learn a lot about a variety of topics so I could be flexible in accepting opportunities. There were times when I applied for positions where my experience was weak, and I used those positions to learn and build my skills.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Take risks and it is ok to fail.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Try different things. Figure out what you really enjoy. You don't want to work in a field you don't enjoy. Being miserable in your job makes for a very long day/week/career.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

I joined the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) which was very active in promoting collaboration opportunities and networking events

**What do you wish you had done differently with regards to your career/education?**

Obtained a MS shortly after obtaining a BS.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I lead a team of engineers working to address a cybersecurity challenge faced by the healthcare sector. I communicate with stakeholders, the team, leadership, the healthcare community to share progress and results. I promote the project at conferences and other public speaking events. I prepare various documents to share status and information about the project.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

The opportunity to perform extensive travel.

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

Ability to communicate with audiences with varied experiences and leadership levels, ability to work with others, ability to analyze disparate information to determine how to move forward. Not being shy to contact someone I don't know to ask for their expertise.

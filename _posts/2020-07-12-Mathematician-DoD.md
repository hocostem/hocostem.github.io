A Bachelor of Arts in mathematics, a secondary teaching certificate in mathematics and a master's of science in discrete mathematics.

Internships and networking. Meeting new people and learning about new opportunities.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

I can't stress enough how important it is to interact with people to learn more about a subject area as well as opportunities for application of the subject area. You never know when a chance meeting will lead to a wonderful opportunity.

High school work study programs, any opportunities for involvement in research.

Lots of coordination on the phone and in email. Communicating results of operations and analytic problems. This requires writing presentations, papers, and effectively communicating in person.

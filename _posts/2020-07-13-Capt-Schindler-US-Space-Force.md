**Why did you choose to pursue this career?  What made you certain this was the right path?**

I have always had a love for space and an interest in how things work.  I took an engineering design class in high school that guided me into studying it for my undergraduate degree.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you to your current job?**

I received an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship and a commission as a Space Operations Officer.

**What schooling, education, and/or certifications did you complete to prepare you for this career?**

B.S. Aeronautical Engineering, Rensselaer 2014
M.S. Aerospace Engineering, NCSU 2019

**How did you make the best use of your time in both your education and career?**

While working as a satellite vehicle operator, I completed my master’s degree online.

**What advice would you give to a high school or college student interested in pursuing this field of work?**

Work hard in your science and math classes! Don’t take schoolwork lightly in high school or college, it’s a full-time job that will pay dividends later in life.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Take every and all Advance Placement exams you can in High School if available.

**What opportunities did you take as a student that helped advance your career (research, internships, etc.)**

ROTC was an amazing opportunity for me that I can’t say enough about.  On top of paying for my education,  the program taught me countless life and professional skills that prepared me to be a military leader.

**What does a typical day at your job look like?**

I work a shift schedule in a 24-hour operations center like most space professionals.

**What was a surprising aspect of your job?**

How little math I actually do day to day.  As a military leader, I guide and manage those who do the mission every day.  

**What qualities are necessary to be successful in your field of work, and why?**

The ability to make decisions quickly and attention to detail.

**Do you have any additional advice?**

Don’t think that you can’t do things. Don’t doubt yourself. Comfort zones are something that are we create for ourselves and do nothing but hold us back.  I had so many moments in my education and career where I was faced with not thinking I was able to do something, my advice would be, go for it.  Always volunteer for something you’re not good at, seek out the things you’re not good at and don’t listen to that idea that you weren’t in the first place.

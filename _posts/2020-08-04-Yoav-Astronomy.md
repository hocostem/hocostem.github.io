**Why did you choose to pursue this major?**

I like exoplanets, I think they're neat. Hopefully one day I'll find some biosignals in exoplanet atmospheres.

**What events, prior employment, or educational experiences led you where you are today? Are you in any specific college programs that you would recommend?**

I met with NASA scientists in my senior year of high school and thought it was amazing, which is why I chose to do astronomy. I'd recommend joining any astronomy club you can in college - it's a great way to learn and make friends at the same time.

**What opportunities would you suggest high school students participate in?**

Any science clubs or opportunities to meet researchers and scientists. It's a great way to figure out early on what you are and aren't interested in.

**What opportunities have you taken to advance your career (research, internships, etc.)? What have you learned through these experiences?**

I currently do research with the aerospace department of my university. It's helped me get a better understanding of the behind-the-scenes of paper publishing and research in astronomy.

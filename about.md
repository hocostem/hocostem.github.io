**HoCoSTEM's mission is to give students guidance to boost their confidence in pursuing STEM disciplines.**

Many students lack confidence when they have no guidance.  All students can benefit from additional resources, however, we especially wish to reach out to STEM minorities, such as women, racial minorities, and those living in poverty who are often underrepresented and hesitant to pursue a career in the STEM fields.  This website is a tool for students to learn more about a variety of STEM disciplines.  The information offered on HoCoSTEM is aimed to promote an awareness of a wide variety of STEM fields.

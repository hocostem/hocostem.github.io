The Howard County STEM website was made as a part of a Girl Scout Gold Award aimed at giving students guidance and confidence in pursuing STEM disciplines.

What is STEM?

STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math.

What is the importance of this project?

Many students lack confidence when they have no guidance.  STEM minorities, such as low income families, women, and racial minorities, are often underrepresented due to a knowledge gap.  This website is a tool for students to research about a variety of STEM disciplines.  The information offered on HoCoSTEM is aimed to promote an awareness of a wide variety of STEM fields.
